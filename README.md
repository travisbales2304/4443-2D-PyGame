>**1**. ALL projects must be turned in and running to earn an A or B in the course.  They don't have to be necessarily correct, but they must run and resemble the project requirements to some degree. 
>
>**2**. Flying home, weddings, or similar are not excuses for missing a final exam or terminating the course early. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students. 


## Miscellaneous

- All students need a [Github](http://github.com) account.
- All students need a discord account. 
- Project Rules:
    - Most projects this semester will be run via screen share for the class to watch.
    - I will accept 1 late project this semester. All others need to be in by the due date or its a zero. 
    - All projects need to be turned in running to do well in the course.
- General Assignment Rules:
    - Due dates and times are as listed on assignment and can change based on multiple factors (feed back, unforeseen problems, etc.) 
    - Formatting of your source code is important, and will be graded accordingly. 
    - Your name is required on ALL documents uploaded or turned in. A handwritten name is not acceptable.
    - All files / programs created by you will end up in your assignments folder within your Github repository. 
    - Programs containing syntax errors are unacceptable and will be returned without grading (your programs must work / run).
- Attendance: 
    - Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. 
    - Students may be dropped for excessive absences. 
    - There is no distinction made between excused and unexcused absences.
    - NOTE: Attendance is not just me picking on you. When bright students congregate, cool things happen. It makes the class better for everyone.
