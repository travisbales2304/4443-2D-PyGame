>**1**. ALL projects must be turned in and running to earn an A in the course.  They don't have to be necessarily correct, but they must run and they must resemble the project requirements to some degree. 
>
>**2**. Flying home, weddings, or similar are not excuses for missing a final exam or terminating the course early. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students. 


## Miscellaneous

- All students need a [Github](http://github.com) account
- All programs need to be turned in to pass the course
- General Assignment Rules:
    - Due dates and times are as listed on assignment and can change with prior notice to class.
    - Formatting of programs is important, and will be graded accordingly. 
    - You name is required on ALL documents uploaded or turned in. Handwritten name is not acceptable.
    - All files / programs created by you will end up in your assignments folder within your Github repository. 
- Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. Students may be dropped for excessive absences. There is no distinction made between excused and unexcused.
- Make-up exams are not given. If I see fit, then I will replace a missed exam with your final exam test grade (but this is optional to instructor based on circumstances, attendance, participation, etc.).
- Programs containing syntax errors are unacceptable and will be returned without grading (your programs must work).
- Periodically homework assignments will be taken up and graded. It is the student's responsibility to keep up with assignments and to ask questions over the assigned work, even if absent. All homework assignments are due at the specified time that may or may not be in conjunction with a class day. All assignments / homeworks will be uploaded via Github.
