>**1**. Projects must run without error.  If they do not run, they will not be graded. Correctness is a different matter. However, the program must be close to the solution required and cannot be an over simplified version simply for the purpose of making it run. In the context of "games" your project should meet a minimum set of requirements as dictated by the written assignment.
>
>**2**. If it turns out that smaller assignments seems to be the best course of action with this class, we will go with scenario 2. It really depends on how the class is doing in general and if a single big project per week will really work. Summer is rough people, so we have to be able to adapt.

>**3**. This is the state of your github repo at the end of the semester. So follow the instructions as stated in the first assignment on how your repo should be set up.

>**4**. You will be grading other students projects. This will give you the opportunity to enjoy other peoples work and creativity. No really. Seriously. Grading is fun and super easy.
>
>**5**. Plane ticket prices, events like weddings, or trips out of the country are not valid excuses for missing the final exam at its scheduled time. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students.

## Important!

- Attending class for online lectures is very different. You will be compelled to miss, or not pay attention and especially not participate. This will make the class kind of suck :( You guys are every as much responsible for the success of this class as I am. I will do my best, but if my online lectures are sparsely attended, and I get little to no feedback, it will be very tough for me to motivate myself to keep allocating set times for unattended lectures. I will however always be available for help! But, lets not test my motivation ... just attend and participate. **Lets make this class awesome!**

- A number of programming assignments will be made to code and execute. The Creation and use of a development environment is part of being a computer science student. I will assist you at the beginning of class with suggested software, but ultimately making your environment work is totally up to you. When all else fails, I can help you via screen share and chat. **However, NOT having your programming environment set up will never be an accepted excuse for late assignments.**

- Projects that don't run will receive a grade of ZERO. You should incrementally code your programs. This means at any given point you should have a running version that you can fall back on. In other words, incrementally add requirements. Don't move on to another requirement if your base code will not run!!  All projects need to be submitted on the day it is due to a location to be determined. Also a version of your program with ALL necessary files to make it run (w/ instructions) will be available on Github in your assignments folder within 6 hours of the due date and time.

- All projects will be uploaded somewhere for the entire class to download and run. Part of your own grade will be your participation in the grading of other students projects. The class will grade your work based on the requirements stated in the actual assignment. I will create rubric's for you to use in your assessment.
